# What is a Hash?

Hashes are sort of like dictionaries. It is a collection of keys and values where you can refer to a value using the associated key, or vice versa.

# What are some examples of information that would be Hashes as opposed to some other data type?

Hashes are useful when you are referring to some value associated with an object, such as an item's price or a person's age. If you wanted to work with prices or ages of a set of values, you would use a Hash.

# How are Hashes and Arrays similar? How are they different?

Arrays and Hashes are both collections of values and can point to various objects that are stored in slots within them.
However, Hashes are not indexed by position number, where each value has a position in the Array indicated by a number. Instead, you can use any value to refer to a particular slot, also called a key. That key could be price, age, etc.
